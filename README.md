# Arpan Murmu — Personal Portfolio 🎮🧠

Hey! I'm Arpan Murmu, a 15 y/o self-taught developer, gamer, and student from India.  
This is my first personal portfolio designed, coded, and hosted entirely by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 🌟 What’s Inside?
- A short intro about me
- Responsive layout (works on all devices)
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- A simple number guessing game 🎲
- 🎵 Background music player (*Blinding Lights* by The Weeknd)

> I made this site to share a bit of my vibe, skills, and personality like a digital version of me.

### 👥 Collaborators
| Name       | Role                     |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Arpan Murmu | Lead Developer / Backend 
|  Anvi       | UI & Playtesting |

> Shoutout to Anvi working on layout, mobile design(all screen optimization), and testing the mini game 🎮

### 📁 Files Breakdown
- `index.html` = main page layout
- `style.css` = all styling
- `script.js` = handles game logic, music control, and dark mode
- `blinding-lights.mp3` = music file included locally
- `README.md` = this file!

### 💡 Why I built this

### 🔧 Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)
